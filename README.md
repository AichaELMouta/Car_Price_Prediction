# Car_Price_Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts used car prices based on features such as brand, model year, mileage, engine capacity, transmission type, and more.
This project compares multiple regression models and identifies the best-performing algorithm based on error metrics.

🚗 Project Overview

This project uses the Car Price Prediction Dataset to analyze how different factors influence the selling price of a used car.
Several regression models were developed and evaluated:

Linear Regression

Lasso Regression

Ridge Regression

ElasticNet Regression

After comparing their performance using RMSE, MAE, and R² score, the Ridge Regression model achieved the best errors with the most stable performance.
